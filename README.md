# Hi! I'm Rainier 👋 👨🏼‍💻

And I'm a passionate Software Engineering student 🎓 . I love to create custom systems, dashboards etc with Laravel and I've been doing so for the last 4 years!

Fun fact: I actually really love cars 🚘.  I almost know every type and model of exotic and specials cars there are (Except oldtimers). Everytime I spot a special car I say the brand and model and it's driving (pun intended) my girlfriend crazy. Currently I dont own a car yet but my dream is to eventually own a nice and special car 😄
