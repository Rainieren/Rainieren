# Hi! I'm Rainier 👋 👨🏼‍💻

I'm a passionate Software Engineering student 🎓 . I love to create custom systems, dashboards etc with Laravel and I've been doing so for the last 5 years! If you are looking for a cheap custom system don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:info@rainierlaan.nl">email me</a>.

I am currently learning alot of diffirent languages. The languages and tools I've worked with are:

- Java
- Python
- PHP (Laravel & Plain)
- HTML, CSS (Sass & Less)
- JavaScript (Plain & jQuery)
- VueJS
- Angular
- GIT
- Magento 2
- TailwindCSS
- Bootstrap
- CI/CD (Pipelines)
- BitBucket & GitLab 
- Docker
- DigitalOcean
- MySQL
And many more just to name a few!

Fun fact: I actually really love cars 🚘.  I almost know every type and model of exotic and specials cars there are (Except oldtimers). Everytime I spot a special car I say the brand and model and it's driving (pun intended) my girlfriend crazy. Currently I dont own a car yet but my dream is to eventually own a Porsche Panamera GTS Grand Turismo 😄
